		Sandbox_ETW_Bloodlust_tooltip = "This allows you to gain a benefit by filling and maintaining a bloodlust meter. The bloodlust meter is soft-capped at 72 hours and can be filled by killing zombies. The closer the zombies are, the more quickly the meter will fill. When you're above half of the meter, every hour it will give you progress towards the bloodlust perk; when it's below, it'll remove progress. The bloodlust meter naturally decays by 1 every hour. Having bloodied clothes helps the process",

		Sandbox_ETW_BloodlustProgress_tooltip = "How much total bloodlust progress you need to get the trait. Be aware that you also lose bloodlust if this meter ever falls below 50%. So if you set it low, it's going to be easy to earn but also easy to lose the perk. Progress is capped at 2x the Bloodlust Progress value",

		Sandbox_ETW_BraverySystemKills_tooltip = "Here you set up how many kills you need to get to max out your bravery system. Melee kills count twice for progress. Progression is as follows: Cowardly -> Fear of Blood -> Pacifist -> Adrenaline Junkie -> Brave -> Desensitized<br>You need to have previous trait gone (if it's negative) or present (if it's positive) to earn/lose next trait In progression.<br>Amounts to reach each stage are as follows:<br>Cowardly: 10% of max kills<br>Fear of Blood: 20% of max kills<br>Pacifist: 30% of max kills<br>Adrenaline Junkie: 40% of max kills<br>Brave: 60% of max kills<br>Desensitized: 100% of max kills<br>Example: Max kills is set to 1000. You start with Cowardly. You need 100 kills to remove it. If you get 50 melee kills, it'll be removed. The same is true if you get 40 melee kills (x2 = 80 kills for the counter) and 20 firearms kills",

		Sandbox_ETW_CatEyesCounter_tooltip = "This allows you to gain points by seeing and observing squares within a certain radius of your character. The number of points you earn is influenced by factors such as the time of day, the darkness of the square, and whether you and the square are inside or outside. The more squares you see and the darker they are, the more points you will earn. Having Eagle Eyed doubles the gain. Making a kill at night triggers extra execution of function responsible for gaining progress (so instead of getting progress 1 time / minute you can get progress 3 times per minute, for example)",

		Sandbox_ETW_FogSystemCounter_tooltip = "You gain progress every minute you spend in fog. Being panicked can slow down the process or even revert it. If the counter is below -counter, you gain Homichlophobia; when reaching counter, you gain Homichlophile. If the counter is between these values, there is no effect. Making a kill at during fog triggers extra execution of function responsible for gaining/losing progress (so instead of getting progress 1 time / minute you can get progress 3 times per minute, for example)",

		Sandbox_ETW_FoodSicknessSystemCounter_tooltip = "Determines how much food sickness you need to accumulate to lose/gain Food Sickness-related traits, Weak Stomach and Iron Gut. Sickness can range from 0 to 1, where 1 can lead to death. Each minute, your current food sickness level is added to the counter.",

		Sandbox_ETW_RainSystemCounter_tooltip = "You gain progress every minute you spend in rain while outside. Being panicked can slow down the process or even revert it. If the counter is below -counter, you gain Pluviophobia; when reaching counter, you gain Pluviophile. If the counter is between these values, there is no effect. Making a kill at during rain triggers extra execution of function responsible for gaining/losing progress (so instead of getting progress 1 time / minute you can get progress 3 times per minute, for example)",

Every minute current cold strength is added to the counter. Being infected with Knox Infection also contributes to counter (so if you run mods that can help you fight infection, like Antibodies, it will help with Immunity System)",
